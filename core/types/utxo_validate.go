// represented in the block chain by a transaction with a single input that has
// a previous output transaction index set to the maximum value along with a
// zero hash.

// transaction as opposed to a higher level util transaction.

// amount, and verifying the signatures to prove the spender was the owner of
// the bitcoins and therefore allowed to spend them.  As it checks the inputs,
// it also calculates the total fees for the transaction and returns that value.
